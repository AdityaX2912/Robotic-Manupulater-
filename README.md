# Robotic-Manupulater-
The arm-like structure of an industrial robot 
is known as a robot manipulator.
 This component is responsible for completing
 the tasks the robot is programmed to perform. 
Also known as a robot arm, the manipulator 
mounts to the robot body and consists of
 multiple links and joints.
 
Description about program

first we need to read the inputs from text file 1,
 which contains the values of 
theta_1, theta_2, and disp_3.
 then read the joint lengths 
from text file 2, which contains 
the values of a1, a2, and a3.
We use the forward kinematics equations 
to calculate the position of the end 
effector of the robotic arm.
Finally, we print the position of the 
end effector on the screen.
